    "There are many similarities between bs4 and selenium, including how to parse and scrape a website. All we need to do is add the link into the .get function and parse it, however the parsing is done a little differently. The syntax is slightly different in that respect, although not drastically. For example, we didn't need to add // when using beautifulsoup4.\n",

    "I found it easier to work with Selenium, al though that may be because I am coding more and so everything is just getting easier. Something to notice is that selenium has more options to parse compared to bs4, but it also has to import more. I don't have to parse with xpath if I want to, I can use CSS_SELECTOR or like 3-4 other ways if I wanted to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I would say I like to use Selenium more because the features it has. When working with BeautifulSoup4, it was sometimes frustrating because the full book titles wouldn't load, which wasn't a problem with Selenium. Working with Selenium would make it easier, especially on long pages like Pnterest (mentioned in the examples book)\n",
