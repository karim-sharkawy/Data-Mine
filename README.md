# Data-Mine
Work I did during the data mine :) The Data Mine is a learning community where students of any major can learn data science concepts and apply them to their projects. This is extremely beneficial for me because it was the first time I was able to use the Python libraries I knew to good use and get practice with them

# What I learned & Experience Acquired
+ Extensible Markup Language (XML)
+ How to scrape and parse websites
+ Using PANDAS in a real-world setting: reading CSV files, exploring them and understanding what they're about, and working with them
+ Cleaning data using PANDAS, plotting using Plotly to visualize trends in data, and removing rows, columns, specific entries in dataframes to get a better understanding of trends
