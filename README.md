# Data-Mine
Work I did during my time at the Purdue Data Mine. The Data Mine is a learning community where students of any major can learn data science concepts and apply them to their projects. This is extremely beneficial for me because it was the first time I could use the Python libraries I learned to good use and get practice with them. For me, it offered real-life coding experience which isn't available in-class. the focus wasn't learning concepts, but applying what you know and what you learned
